Electronics Engineer with a focus on applied Computer Science, I integrate hardware knowledge with Computer Security expertise. I have experience as a System Deployment Engineer at TapToPay (Mohar), with a strong foundation in Cybersecurity, IT Essentials, and Embedded Systems.

Simple tools I build don't change the internet rather, they solve problems 

I am passionate about creating tools that are both simple and impactful. In 2020, I founded HackASat Nepal to inspire top cybersecurity talent to develop the skills necessary to secure the final frontier—space. Currently, I serve as the Vice President of TheThingsNetwork (Kathmandu), where I am building a global IoT ecosystem using LoRaWAN.
